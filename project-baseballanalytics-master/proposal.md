## Project proposal

The dataset I plan on using comes from the 2017 TruMedia Networks Hackathon and is already fully cleaned and available in both CSV and JSON formats. Although I didn’t participate in the hackathon, I was granted permission to use the dataset from the competition.  

The data includes metrics on every pitch from the 2014, 2015, and 2016 MLB seasons, including the 2016 World Series.  To see which metrics were tracked, you can view the instructions from the hackathon (https://www.dropbox.com/s/c4s9cftg8nh93l2/HackathonProjects.pdf?dl=0).  

I’m not completely sure what I’ll be exploring in depth yet, but I plan on considering the following:
- Quantifying fatigue
	- Currently, pitching coaches and managers consider decreases in velocity, command, or faltering technique as the factors that determine when a pitcher is fatigued and should be pulled from the game.  
	- I’d like to explore whether or not other factors (spin rate, spin direction, horizontal/vertical velocity, etc.) can help determine fatigue
	- My final product would be a fatigue score that automatically updates after each pitch that could help managers determine when to pull their pitcher or not.
- Predicting future pitcher performance
	- What’s the best predictor of in-game pitching performance? Are the last 5-10 pitches/pitches in the game thus far/pitches from the entire season the best predictor of future performance in the middle of a game?
- Do some batters thrive against certain release points?
	- Given certain release points, do some batters perform better? If they do, is there a way to mathematically determine whether or not they should start over another teammate, or determine who should pinch hit in a given situation?
